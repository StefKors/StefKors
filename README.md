Design engineer with over 15 years of experience building productivity software across web, macOS, and iOS.

I work at the intersection of design and engineering: architecture, UI systems, design details and shipping product. Currently at [Beside](https://beside.com/) building cross-platform AI applications in SwiftUI, React, Electron, and Rust. Previously led the design system and technical rewrite at [Kosmik](https://kosmik.app), and built the core Web Capture feature at [Beam](https://beamapp.co).

## What I work on

- **Cross-platform product engineering**: Shipping apps for desktop and mobile with Swift, SwiftUI, React, Rust and more
- **Designing Productivity Tools**: Crafting user experiences down to the details with quality and speed
- **Design systems**: Building component libraries, establishing standards, and maintaining consistency across products
- **Developer tools**: Native macOS utilities and productivity apps, mostly in SwiftUI
- **AI interfaces**: Live transcription, agentic meeting capture, conversational UI
