# Design Engineer

I design and build desktop tools that help people think, work, and create better. My work sits at the intersection of product design and engineering â€” where beautiful interfaces meet high-performance code. I work across platforms with years of experience in Swift, SwiftUI, TypeScript, React and Vue.

Iâ€™m passionate about crafting productivity apps and tools that feel intuitive, fast, and thoughtfully designed. Recent projects explore topics like [visual note-taking](https://www.kosmik.app/), [web browsers](https://stefkors.com/beam-browser/), and [AI interfaces](https://interfaceai.com/).
- Building native tools in SwiftUI, with an eye for UX detail
- Focused on bridging design systems, native UI, and web technologies
- Creator of [Commitment](https://stefkors.com/commitment/), [Affability](https://stefkors.com/affability/), and [other desktop productivity experiments](https://github.com/StefKors/GitLab)
- Based in The Hague, Netherlands
