# Design Engineer

I design and build desktop tools that help people think, work, and create better. My work sits at the intersection of product design and engineering — where beautiful interfaces meet high-performance code. I work across platforms with years of experience in Swift, SwiftUI, TypeScript, React and Vue.

I’m passionate about crafting productivity apps and tools that feel intuitive, fast, and thoughtfully designed. Recent projects explore topics like [visual note-taking](https://www.kosmik.app/), [web browsers](https://stefkors.com/beam-browser/), and [AI interfaces](https://interfaceai.com/).
	•	💻 Building native tools in SwiftUI, with an eye for UX detail
	•	🧩 Focused on bridging design systems, native UI, and web technologies
	•	🚀 Creator of [Commitment](https://stefkors.com/commitment/), [Affability](https://stefkors.com/affability/), and [other desktop productivity experiments](https://github.com/StefKors/GitLab)
	•	🌍 Based in The Hague, Netherlands
